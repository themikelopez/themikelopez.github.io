										<h2>Project Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This was one of my earlier contracts, on which I worked alongside the fantastic team at <a href="https://www.blue-spruce.co/" target="_blank">BlueSpruce Collaborative Studio</a>. This was a wonderful learning opportunity for me to see more of the client/designer/developer interaction, 
										as well as see the design process from start to finish and witness how it evolves overtime with input from the client and the users. Wireframing UI for UX flow, asset creation, and custom code creation were part of my involvement in this project.</p>
									<p>This site has since changed, but that simply goes to show the evolving nature of websites and the marketing goals of clients over time. I will update this page soon to showcase some of the work we had completed for Stage.</p>

										<h2>About The Work</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Following the process of the lead designer, we went through various options for UX flow and color palettes to see how they could effect the impact of the site. With this 
										being a Squarespace site, I was able to get some hands on experience with the developer console and really get a feel for building a website with the platform. I particularly
										 enjoyed the ease of use and had the chance to use both versions (7.0 & 7.1).</p>
									<p>On this project, I assisted with some custom code along with input for site design, UX and implementation. Squarespace luckily has the ability to add custom CSS code quite
										 easily, even more so with the previous (7.0) version. One of the original directions we had gone with this project was to develop a portfolio page that would display an image tile that
										 would be in grey-scale, then on hover, it would transition into color. The image tile was a link to a page with more information on that
										  featured company. By fading to a colored image, the link was intuitive to the user along with some directional copy to guide them.</p>
									<p>Calling upon my knowledge of CSS transition effects, and some helpful Chrome developer tools, I was able to isolate the correct block family we needed to apply the transition to. 
										I was successfully able to pull off the desired effect for the client; however, in the end, they opted to go another route and the transition effect was not used. It was a very 
										helpful learning experience for me though, in that I was able to figure out exactly what element in the Squarespace theme I wanted to customize and then I was able to inject 
										custom code that I had created and achieve the effect I was looking for.</p> 
									<p>As simple as the code was, the process of coming to a momentary roadblock of something I was not well versed in (transition properties),
										I was able to use the documents available online and forums in the developer communities to solve the problem at hand and come up with a solution. My developer skills expanded with this project through 
										overcoming an obstacle and expanding my knowledge about a particular CSS property. Having the ability to problem solve in this way is invaluable in this industry and I have used it many times since entering this field.
