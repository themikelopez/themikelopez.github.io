# This is my main Github Page, and is supposed to act as a digital portfolio that will evolve over time. 
# I'm a self motivated developer and designer with the intent of making clean coded as well as friendly and intuitive UI/UX. 
# Making my content accessible to more people is something I want to make sure I am thinking about as I design.


# Thanks for taking the time to check out my Github and reading this README. Cheers!
