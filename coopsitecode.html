										<h2>About The Work</h2>
									</header>
									<p>With this contract, I was given the reigns to lead in design implementation and to help collaborate on the redesign and re-branding. Working with the team 
										at BlueSpruce, we completely reinvented Innovation Pet into Coops & Feathers. Their Shopify e-commerce site needed to reflect these major changes and showcase their new brand identity
									to pivot from a provider of a wide variety of pet products to a more refined, core foundation of products to represent the new direction of Coops & Feathers.</p>
									<p>Communicating often with the client to make sure the site was honed to reflect exactly what they were working for, we were able to rapidly and efficiently deliver a new website that was ready to start taking orders immediately.</p> 
									<p>In the final phases of the project, the clients desired to add a pre-order feature to the site. I took lead on this and began implementing the feature through the process of researching and vetting different apps that would be compatible with Shopify. Unfortunately, the app I originally had hoped would work with
										our theme did not; however, it was a valuable learning experience.</p> 
									<p>During the troubleshooting process, I had to contact the development team for that particular pre-order app and attempt to find a solution together. Working with their support team and developers, we made an effort to work our way through the app's failure and determine where we were running into issues.</p> 
									<p>In the end, we were not able to successfully get the initial app to integrate, so I ultimately went with another app that worked with our theme template and was able to deliver for the client.</p>
